Drivers:
    Install AMD APP SDK v3 or Intel OpenCL Runtime 15.1 to process kernels on CPUs.
    If the framework is not detected, make sure that a file pointing to libOpenCl.so is in /etc/OpenCl/vendors/.

    Install beignet, AMD Crimson or NVidia GeForce drivers to execute kernels on GPUs

Windows/Visual Studio:
    If you checked out the source code on a network drive add the following entry
        <loadFromRemoteSources enabled="true"/>
    to the <runtime> region in the following file:
        C:\\programfiles (x86)\microsoft visualstuddio 14.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe.config

    Use cmake-gui to create a visual studio solution.

Linux:
    sudo apt-get install clinfo ocl-icd-dev ocl-icd-opencl-dev ocl-icd-libopencl1 opencl-headers cmake g++
    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    ./bench
  
    # Note: some proprietary drivers or frameworks like to overwrite libOpenCl or clinfo provided by the ubuntu
    # packages. that's okay as long as there are any on the system... if you remove those, reinstall the drivers
    # again (if apt complains about conflicting packages, use dpkg instead to remove the troublesome ones)
