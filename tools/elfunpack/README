Description:

    Extracts section content from an elf container. The section is described by its name.

Example:

    ./elfunpack inputFile.bin .llvmir outputFile.bin

Purpose:

    The AMD APP SDK if asked to dump a compiled OpenCL kernel stores all the information in elf containers.
    The LLVM IR is stored in a section identified by .llvmir
    Converting it to a readable form is done by:

    llvm-dis-3.6 outputFile.bin -o outputFile.bc        # tested with version 3.5 and 3.6, others might work as well
