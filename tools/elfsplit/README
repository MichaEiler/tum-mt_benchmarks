Description:

    Splits a binary file into separate files by a given string identifier.

Example:

    ./elfsplit inputFile.bin BC outputFilePrefix

Purpose:

    The kernel code dumped by the intel framework is not fully compatible with the elf standard.
    Therefore we simply split it by looking for the 'BC' string signifying the start of llvm bytecode.
